## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

it took me hours of redoing the entire thing due to me getting dot, dot, dots instead of numbers to decimal places for the text fields
I also had trouble adding a navigation editor page until I finally figured it out through a forum post and subsequently the additional settings part on the prework.
I can do the entire thing by memory now though.
